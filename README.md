# Python-distributable-creator
A small script that allows the use to turn python projects into folders that can be shared with anyone easily

### How to use
To use, just put everything your project need (All assets, and the main script file of course).
The script then asks you to select a python version. There are some that have been tested and work with this script. If you want to use another version of python, select the option ```custom```, then input the version. For example ```3.9.2```. Once installed, the script then installs pip and prompts you to type everything you want to install. Once finished with the package installation, type ```quit```.
The last step is to type the name of the main python file.
The script then copies the files from input to the output folder. You are then able to start your script with the .bat file.


### Why use this script?

This script lets you create those sharable python scripts without much stress, as it automatically applies the patches required to install pip.
This could be done manually, but the script makes it easier, faster and safer.
